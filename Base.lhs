The class DiscretePartialOrderWithMinimum contains the functions needed for the BUFIA learning algorithm.
Functions `minimum` and `size` are self-explantory.
x <:< y is True iff x is less than y (structure x is contained within structure y)                    
`nextGreaterThan` returns the set of structures that are greater than 'a' by one step in the partial order.             
x <:< ys is True iff x is less than any element of y (structure x is contained within any structure y)
x >:> ys is True iff any y is less than x (any y is contained in x)

-- >   minimum :: a

-- >   (<:<) :: a -> a -> Bool

`close f xs` returns the closure of xs under f.
It assumes f is monotonically increasing
and that there is a ceiling.

> closeSet :: Eq a => (Set a -> Set a) -> Set a -> Set a
> closeSet f xs 
>   | xs == nxs = xs
>   | otherwise = closeSet f nxs
>   where nxs = f xs

> closeMap :: (Eq k, Ord k, Eq d) => (Map k d -> Map k d) -> [Map k d] -> Map k d
> closeMap f maplist 
>   | Map.null nextMap = List.foldl' Map.union Map.empty maplist 
>   | otherwise = closeMap f (nextMap:maplist)
>   where nextMap = f (head maplist)

> zeroIntersect :: Ord a => Set a -> Set a -> Bool
> zeroIntersect xs ys = Set.null (Set.intersection xs ys)

`findUpdate f key map` looks up the data associated with key in map
and returns the pair (data,map). If Nothing is found, it computes
the data with `f key` and returns the pair (data,updated map).

> findUpdate :: (Eq d, Ord k) => (k -> d) -> k -> Map k d -> (d, Map k d)
> findUpdate f key map =
>   if result == Nothing
>   then (newValue, Map.insert key newValue map)
>   else (fromJust result, map)
>   where result = Map.lookup key map
>         newValue = f key

`exciseNothings xs` returns a set without the Nothing values

> insertExceptNothing :: Ord a => Set a -> Maybe a -> Set a
> insertExceptNothing xs Nothing = xs
> insertExceptNothing xs (Just x) = Set.insert x xs

> exciseNothings :: Ord a => Set (Maybe a) -> Set a
> exciseNothings = Set.foldl' insertExceptNothing Set.empty 


`setDoubleFold` is a product construction for sets.

> setDoubleFold :: (Ord a, Ord b) => (a -> a -> b) -> Set a -> Set a -> Set b
> setDoubleFold f xs ys = Set.foldl
>                         (\ys' y -> Set.union
>                                    ys'
>                                    (Set.foldl
>                                      (\xs' x -> Set.insert (f x y) xs')
>                                      Set.empty
>                                      xs)
>                         )
>                         Set.empty
>                         ys

`setZipWith` does a product construction over sets of lists.

> setZipWith' :: Ord a => ([a] -> [a] -> [a]) -> [a] -> Set [a] -> Set [a]
> setZipWith' f x = Set.foldl' (\zs y -> Set.insert (f x y) zs) Set.empty

> setZipWith :: Ord a => ([a] -> [a] -> [a]) -> Set [a] -> Set [a] -> Set [a]
> setZipWith f xs ys = Set.foldl' (\zs x -> Set.union zs (setZipWith' f x ys)) Set.empty xs


Concatenates two finite languages
(finite sets of finitely long sequences)

> (+++) :: Ord a => Set [a] -> Set [a] -> Set [a]
> (+++) = setDoubleFold (++) 

Returns the concatenation of a list of languages.

> (++++) :: Ord a => [(Set [a])] -> Set [a]
> (++++) [] = Set.empty
> (++++) xs = List.foldl' (+++) (Set.singleton []) xs

Returns the set of all sequences of length k from a given list of symbols

> kStrings :: Ord a => Int -> [a] -> Set [a]
> kStrings k alph = (++++) (List.map Set.fromList (replicate k alph'))
>   where alph' = List.map (:[]) alph

combine xs ys z returns the list xs ++ [z] ++ ys

> combine :: [a] -> [a] -> a -> [a]
> combine left right x = left ++ x:right

combineAll xs ys zs returns a set of lists which combines each z in zs with the lists xs and ys

> combineAll :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> Set a -> Set [a]
> combineAll left right xs = Set.foldl' (\ys x -> Set.insert (combine left right x) ys) Set.empty xs

indexWord is self-explantory.

> indexWord :: [a] -> [(a,Int)]
> indexWord word = List.zip word [0 .. List.length word - 1]

dosomething f x n word splits the word at index n into left and
right words. The element at position n is lost (but will be
supplied as x in pointwiseApply below). Function f is applied to x
resulting in a set of xs. Then combineAll left right xs is
computed.

> dosomething :: Ord a => (a -> Set a) -> a -> Int -> [a] -> Set [a]
> dosomething f x n word = combineAll left right xs where
>   (left,headright) = List.splitAt n word
>   right = List.tail headright
>   xs = f x 

pointwiseApply f word applies the function f pointwise within the
word and collects the results as a set. Function f takes each
element of the list to a set of elements. Each element in (f xs) is
then used to produce a new list which is added to the set.

> pointwiseApply :: Ord a => (a -> Set a) -> [a] -> Set [a]
> pointwiseApply f word = List.foldl'
>                         (\ys (x,n) -> Set.union (dosomething f x n word) ys)
>                         Set.empty

`toFactors Succ k (==)` returns all subfactors (successor model) of size k
`toFactors Succ k (<=)` returns all subfactors (successor model) up to size k inclusive

compareByIndex assumes x1 and x2 are elements of xs
`compareByIndex x1 x2` == GT iff x1 occurs EARLIER in the list

Encoding and Decoding

Encoding and Decoding elements of type a requires a list of xs :: [a]
list represents a bijection between its elements and the natural
numbers by index.

encode' xs x returns Just the index or Nothing if x is not in xs.

> encode' :: Eq a => [a] -> a -> Maybe Int
> encode' xs x = List.findIndex (==x) xs

decode' xs n returns Just the element at index n in xs otherwise returns Nothing

> decode' :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a
> decode' xs n
>   | n < 0
>     || n >= length xs = Nothing
>   | otherwise = Just (xs !! n)

encode xs x returns the index in xs of x or -1 if there is no x in xs.

> encode :: Eq a => [a] -> a -> Int
> encode xs x = maybe (-1) id $ List.findIndex (==x) xs

decode xs n returns the element at index n or an error if n is outside the range of xs.
Best to use when n is known to be in [0 .. (length xs) - 1]

> decode :: [a] -> Int -> a
> decode = (!!) 


> indices :: [a] -> [Int]
> indices xs = [0 .. length xs - 1]
